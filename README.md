We have thus created a web game which can be launched instantly without the need to
download any software. It runs entirely in the user’s browser. The user can add the game to
their device’s home screen if they wish to do so, in order to make it easier and more seamless
to access the game. The game utilizes powerful 3D graphics powered by PlayCanvas and
WebGL along with real-time multiplayer powered by NodeJS and SocketIO to provide a next
generation web experience that pushes the boundaries of what’s possible on the web.
<p>
We have made the game easily accessible for players. Players only need to enter their username
and they are instantly added to the matchmaking queue without any signup/login or any sort of
account creation process. They can instantly and anonymously chat with other players. All this
makes it easier for users to quickly pick up the game and start playing.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
